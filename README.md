> Velen has been unmaintained for over years now. For slash commands and context menus, we recommend using the successor framework [`Nexus`](https://github.com/ShindouMihou/Nexus) instead
> which has been actively maintained since Velen went inactive and is used more, always kept up-to-date with Discord's latest changes.

Aiming to become the Laravel of Javacord; Velen is a framework for Discord bots using Javacord with complete features from hybrid (message and slash commands), slash commands, prefix managers, blacklists, fuzzy command search, cooldowns and many more. 

The aim of Velen is to reduce the time it takes for developers to setup a Discord bot without compromising on performance.

where everything is more organized and easier to read.

## üìö Wiki & Guide

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Installation
You can install Velen from Maven Central, otherwise known as Sonatype, which also hosts Javacord and many 
other libraries.

### üì¶ Maven
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>pw.mihou</groupId>
    <artifactId>Velen</artifactId>
    <version>3.1.1</version>
</dependency>
```

### üì¶ Gradle
```groovy
implementation 'pw.mihou:Velen:3.1.1'
```

## ‚õ∞Ô∏è Velen is used by
- [Amelia](https://github.com/ManaNet/Amelia): A Discord bot that is dedicated to a webnovel site called ScribbleHub.
- More to be added, feel free to create an issue if you want to add yours here!

## üîÆ Version Policy
Velen has a specific version policy, in which, unless there is a critical change to be made, an update will only be released on
either of these conditions (this is to prevent me from overworking):
- 3+ issues (bug fixes, feature requests, improvements, etc).
- A critical bug fix.
- A new Javacord update.

The library also follows a similar version number policy with Javacord:
- A change in the first digit of the version will mean: **major update or two-three major breaking change**.
- A change in the second digit of the version will mean: **a large quantity of __accumulated__ updates or a breaking change**.
- A change in the last digit of the version will mean: **a minor update, usually new features or fixes**.
